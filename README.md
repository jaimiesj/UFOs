# UFOs: Javascript and Beyond
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this analysis was to take javascript listed data and create a webpage that tabulated that data that then was able to have filters applied to it.

## Results 
In order to generate search results, the code filters through the table and yields results that match the search. The event JS listens for is input followed by an automatic refresh. I ran into a challenge with the event JS needed to listen to and was unable to resolve that in order to properly filter through the table.

## Summary
This new design does not utilize a filter button, which I think is not as intuitive. I would recommend putting a filter button back in place as well as change the text case to look more professional. I would also incorporate images of the actual shapes, as a reference.
